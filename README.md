# CrimeKGQA: Crime Investigation Assistant

CrimeKGQA is an AI-powered question answering and visualization system for crime investigation, built on a Neo4j crime knowledge graph. It enables users to ask natural language questions about crimes, suspects, locations, and evidence, and receive both textual answers and interactive graph visualizations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Knowledge Graph Backend:** Neo4j stores and queries a large-scale crime knowledge graph (POLE model: Person, Object, Location, Event).
- **Natural Language Q&A:** Maps user questions to Cypher queries using templates (easily extensible to LLMs).
- **Interactive Visualization:** Displays graph-based answers using Pyvis and NetworkX.
- **Modern UI:** Streamlit-based chat interface for easy and intuitive interaction.
- **Containerized Deployment:** All components run via Docker Compose for easy setup and reproducibility.

---

## 🏁 Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CrimeKGQA.git
cd CrimeKGQA
```

### 2. Add Your Data

- Place your Neo4j database dump (e.g., `pole.dump`) in the `data/` directory.
- **Do not commit the `data/` directory to git** (it's in `.gitignore`).

### 3. Build and Start the System

```
docker compose up --build
```

- Neo4j: [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474) (user: `neo4j`, pass: `test`)
- Streamlit app: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

### 4. Load the POLE Dataset into Neo4j

```
docker exec -it crimekgqa-neo4j bin/neo4j-admin load --from=/data/pole.dump --database=graph.db --force
docker restart crimekgqa-neo4j
```

---

## 💡 Usage

- Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.
- Ask questions like:
  - "Identify people involved in multiple crimes and find their connections."
  - "Which geographical areas have the highest crime rates?"
  - "Show all associates of Amy."
- View the generated Cypher query and interactive network visualization for each answer.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- Neo4j 3.5/4.0
- Pyvis, NetworkX
- Streamlit
- Docker, Docker Compose

---

## ⚙️ Customization

- **Add More Question Templates:**  
  Edit `simple_cypher_template()` in `kg_query.py` to support more question types or integrate an LLM for dynamic Cypher generation.
- **Change Database Connection:**  
  Edit environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` or `.env`.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- **Do NOT commit the `data/` directory or Neo4j system files to git.**
- For large datasets or dumps, consider sharing via cloud storage or Git LFS.
